Hey, I’m Daniel!

I’m interested in Computer Science, in nearly any and all regards. Here you'll find my various projects, though admittedly I dont use github often. Hopefully that changes in the future!

DanDigits/DanDigits is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
